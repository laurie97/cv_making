Q: When will you finish your current role?

   I am currently a third-year PhD student and I am on course to writing up by September 2017.

Q: Are you able to start full-time employment after finishing this Fellowship (due to finish 27th Oct 2017)? What is the notice period on your current employment (if any)?

   I am able to start full-time employment immediately after the course. The only requirement I have is to have finished the writing up procedure

Q: Where are you interested in working?

   - Anywhere in Europe

Q: Do you have the right to work in the UK?

   Yes, I am a UK citizen so have to right to work in UK and across Europe

Q: Do you have any experience in the various sub-domains of data science (include details of any coding, statistics, machine learning courses, etc)? Describe them.

   - Coding: Strong: Python, C++, Root
     	     Some:   SQL
	     Libraries: Skicit Learn, Numpy, Scipy

   - Stats: Large scale statistics project (ATLAS)
     	    Significance, p-values, look-else where effect, exclusion limits.	    
   - ML courses: - Kaggle
		 - Hackathon
		 - Skicit Learn Tutorials,Gilles Louppe, IML ML Workshop, CERN.
		 - Machine Learning Academic Lectures (Kagan, Jonathon Shlens)


   I have a wide experience in coding within the work as part of my PhD and previous summer projects.
   I have 3+ years experience of coding in Python and C++ within large scale data-analyses used in scientific publications,
   mainly using ROOT, the predominant statistical analysis programme within the field.
   I also have experience of using wider python libraries, including Skicit-Learn, Numpy and Scipy, through online tutorials and private projects.
   In addition, I have some experience of using SQL through online tutorials.
   This demonstrates my ability and willingness to learn new programming languages and adapt to the requirements of data analysis within a specific industry.

   In addition I have extensive experience of using statistics to analyse large data-sets,
   specifically experience of analysing the quality of fits to distributions,
   and calculating the significance of deviations within a data-set.

   I also have an interest in and have attended courses on Machine Learning,
   including Skicit Learn tutorials held by a library developer Geilles Louppe at a ML workshop held at CERN,
   and a set of three "Machine Learning Academic Lectures" held at CERN, including a lectrue by Jonathon Shlens of Deep Mind Google.
   I have also applied ML to data-sets from Kaggle using Skicit-Learn library.
   
   

Q: Can you tell us about your favourite part of your PhD / current role?

   - Problem Solving Process
     - A problem is posed
     - We discussed as a group and proposed a solution
     - Code it up
     - Present results
   - Satifying process running from problem to solution


Q: Can you explain something complicated and interesting in about 250 words?

   **** Should work on soon ****
   Ideas:
   - Trigger (I like the trigger)
   - Some physics concept (SR?)
   - Statistical significance


Q: What was the highest level mathematical class you took? Have you won any science or maths prizes?

   - Theoretical Physics (Highly mathematical)
     - Quantum Field Theory
     - Lagrangain Mechanics
     - Look up further

Q: Can you tell us how you stay organised, or how you keep others organised?

   - Calender Mac
   - To Do list: Daily
   - Longterm logbooke

Q: What excites you about data science?

   *** Can do soon ****
   - Problem solving process
      - Real world problems 	     
      - Discussion in a team
      - Take large data-set
      - Apply complicated statistical procedures to get a deeper understanding of the data
   - Solve problem and get a deeper understaning real world, that no-one has had before.

Q: Can you tell us about a side project you've worked on?

   Kaggle it!!
   - Titanic
   - Fantasy Premier League?
   - Some other idea?

Q: Where did you hear about the ASI Fellowship?

   - Speaking to collegues who are in the field who give the course a very high praise and great reccomendations
   - Posters and research on website.
