Q: Can you tell us about your favourite part of your PhD / current role?

   - Problem Solving Process
     - A problem is posed
     - We discussed as a group and proposed a solution
     - Code it up
     - Present results
   - Satifying process running from problem to solution


Q: Can you explain something complicated and interesting in about 250 words?

   **** Should work on soon ****
   Ideas:
   - Trigger (I like the trigger)
   - Some physics concept (SR?)
   - Statistical significance


Q: What was the highest level mathematical class you took? Have you won any science or maths prizes?

   - Theoretical Physics (Highly mathematical)
     - Quantum Field Theory

Q: Can you tell us how you stay organised, or how you keep others organised?

   - Calender Mac
   - To Do list: Daily
   - Longterm logbooke

Q: What excites you about data science?

   *** Can do soon ****
   - Problem solving process
      - Real world problems 	     
      - Discussion in a team
      - Take large data-set
      - Apply complicated statistical procedures to get a deeper understanding of the data
   - Solve problem and get a deeper understaning real world, that no-one has had before.
