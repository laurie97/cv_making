I am applying

This role really interests me as it would allow me to take the technical skills I've learnt from my PhD
and apply them to create impact in a real world problem such as online advertising.
I would relish the challenges and rewards of using cutting-edge statistical and computational techniques on a complex and large data-set to be able
to improve the effectiveness of a companies advertising campaign,
and I would also enjoy the opportunity to obtain a broader knowledge of the advertising market and those of your clients.
Finally, I know from my experience of working at the CERN campus in Geneva,
that the international collaborative of Criteo within the diverese city of Paris would suit me well.

I believe that I have good analytical and statistical skills that would make me well qualified for this job.
My research involves searching for signs of new physics 
that corresponds to attempting to identify for 100s of discrepant data-points within a PB data-set;
this has required use of a machine-learning algorithm to improve identification of events of interest,
regression techniques to model large backgrounds,
and  bayesian hypothesis testing to quantify the results.
As part of this research, I led the measurement of the performance of the $b$-trigger,
a vital component of the data-aquisition used in our experiment.
I helped identify that the $b$-trigger was performing well below expectations,
understand the reasons for this
and work with experts to mitigate the issue in the effected data.
