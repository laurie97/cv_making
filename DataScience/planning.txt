###### Personal Statement

I am a Physicist working as part of the ATLAS collaboration analysing the huge amount of data produced by the Large Hadron Collider experiment,
in the search for new physics.
This has given me experience of analysing and understanding large data sets within a collaborative environment as well as experience of presenting conclusions from that data to a range of audiences.
and I would be interested in expanding uponto analyse new data-sets from real world situations.
I believe that my natural curiosity, computational skills and strong mathematical problem solving background, make me well suited to a role in data science.


###### Research Experience

UCL, Particle Physics PhD Student 

I am a member of the ATLAS collaboration that analyses the large number of high energy particle collisions provided by the Large Hadron Collider.
This involves collaborating on large scale data analysis using Python and C++,

My key roles are:

- An analyser in a team searching for new physics using pairs of b-jets.
  I work within a team searches for new physics as a "bump" in the otherwise smooth background distributions.
  We use a multi-variate algorithm to identify objects called b-jets, which increases our signal to background ratio.
  My specific roles include analysing the background and validating the fit function used to model the background,
  using pseudo-datasets taken from monte-carlo simulation.
  
- Lead analyser measuring the efficiency of the ATLAS b-jet trigger.
  The trigger is a tool used to reduce the data taking rate to a managable amount by making an in-time decision on whether to store or delete data on each event.
  This measurement required understanding a complicated data-set, as some regions of data-taking had different behaviour, the performance 
  The efficiency of the b-jet trigger measurement is required by other analyses within the collaboration to proceed to publication,
  so this measurement had to performed to deadlines and communicated in an effective way to the users.
  
 - I have presented slides of my work at many different levels; in technical detail within smaller weekly working groups, to the wider scientific comminity at workshops and conferences and to the public and schools as part of outreach, showing that I have experience of presenting complicated data analysis to a range of audiances and at a range of detail levels.
 - Attended lecture courses including  postgraduate courses at UCL and a CERN summer schools that include lectures on statistics and the use of machine learning in data analysis
